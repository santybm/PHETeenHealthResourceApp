PHETeenHealthResourceApp
========================

The Teen Health Resource App for Peer Health Exchange provides teens with a city-specific, quick, and comprehensive list of health hotlines, websites, and local health centers where teens can get help or more information right at the palm of their hand. The hotlines and websites are organized according to the different health topics covered in PHE workshops. There are also some hotlines and websites that provide more general information that could be useful for a range of teen needs or questions related to their health (e.g. legal resources).
